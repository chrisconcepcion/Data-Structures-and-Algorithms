Types of Programming Problems:


GREEDY
Greedy problems usually look "find the minimum or maximum"  of
something to do something. Or "find the minimum or maximum" of something to fit
in some conditions.

The idea of a greedy algo is to pick the locally optimal move for each step
that will lead to the globally optimal solution.

How do you prove your greedy algo provides globally optimal solution?

Proof by contradiction https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction

To solve greedy problems

1. think of interactions needed to get to desired result
2. determine the local optimal move
3. prove by Proof_by_contradiction
